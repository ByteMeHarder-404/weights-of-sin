Journal Compass is a modern, two-page web application designed to help researchers find the **perfect journal** for their work.  
Built for the **Hackops 2.5 hackathon**, it combines a sleek UI with an integrated **JournalMatch AI** engine that analyzes a research paper’s title and abstract to recommend the most suitable journals.
